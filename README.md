# This is the portfolio for recent Kenzie graduate Fernando Puente | Full Stack Web Developer

This portfolio was created to showcase what I learned during my 9 months training as a Software Developer and Im excited to share my skills and also some of the cool things I have been able to build during my time at Kenzie.

The stack I chose to use was the MERN stack which is what we used primarily during school and I had a great time using Bootstrap and its components while working on the front-end side of my capstone project Memories Booking.
